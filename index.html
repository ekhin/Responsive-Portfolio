        My name is Ei Wai Khin. I am originally from Myanmar (Burma), a country next to Thailand, China, and India.
        I've been living in the California for 10 years.  I lived in San Francisco and went to City College of San Francisco. 
        Then I majored in Economics at UC Berkeley and now I'm studying at UC Berkeley Extension coding bootcamp while working
        full-time in Cupertino. The academic rigor at UC Berkeley and my diverse work experiences have sharpened my 
        analytical skills and critical thinking abilities.

        I love to go skiing in the winter and go to beach in warmer weather. In my free time, I like to hike, play badminton,
        and watch movies. However, I don't like watching movies in a theater because of their uncomfortable chair, loud sound
        systems, no pausing during movie when I want to do something, and the ticket is expensive. All the above reasons are why
        I often wait for a movie to release on Netflix.<br>
      <br>
      I'm in this coding bootcamp because I would like to become a Full Stack Developer at my current company.
